# **CLI Account Management System (AMS)**
> ## **Welcome message**:
Hello and welcome to my second python project. As this is only my second project there is definetely going to be one or two bugs or things COULD have been done in a cleaner more effiecient way. But, i humbly ask you to not judge me too harshly when viewing my work. I think i will be doing more and more projects in the future to hone my skills furthur, and maybe even start with other more advanced languages. **Anyway, thank you for taking time out of you day to view my work**. :)

>## **IMPORTANT**:
If you are going to download and run the project, remember to change the **filepath** variable at the top of the code **(line 4)**. I've made sure the code dosent break with a faulty filepath but it also wont function properly without it, *ie. the passwords will not be saved*.

## **DISCLAIMER**
** I DID NOT IMPLEMENT ANY SECURITY FEATURES IN THE PROGRAM AS OF THIS MOMENT, DO NOT ENTER ANY REAL ACCOUNTS OR PASSWORDS AS IT WILL BE VISIBLE FOR ANYONE TO SEE IN THE `users.json` FILE!!**
